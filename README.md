# BCS Homework 2: Responsive Portfolio
The purpose of this project is to create a three-page portfolio using the Bootstrap framework to make it responsive to screen sizes and have a mobile-friendly layout.  
The three pages are:
- an index/home page with a biography, image, and professional profile links
- a portfolio page showcasing work done
- a contact page with a message submission form.

The pages all have a matching custom style overlaid on top of the Bootstrap framework, and all have header and footer elements on either side of a main container class content section. The headers include a collapsing Bootstrap-style navigation bar. The main content areas on each page use Bootstrap Cards inside Bootstrap rows and columns. The Portfolio page has further rows and columns within the main card, and these are filled with more cards (for listings of existing projects) or placeholder images (to mark space for future listed projects). The form on the Contact page is currently non-functional.
